            Duilio was the lead ship of the Duilio class of ironclad turret ships built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Named for the Roman admiral Gaius Duilius, the ship was laid down in January 1873, was launched in May 1876, and was completed in January 1880. She was armed with a main battery of four 450 mm (17.7 in) guns, then the largest gun afloat, and she was capable of a top speed of around 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph).<br/><br/>Duilio's career was uneventful. She spent her first two decades in service with the Active and Reserve Squadrons, primarily tasked with training maneuvers and exercises. She was withdrawn from front-line duty in 1902 and thereafter employed as a training ship, though this role only lasted until 1909 when she was converted into a floating oil tank and renamed GM40. The ship's ultimate fate is unknown.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Duilio-class ironclads were designed by the noted Italian naval architect Benedetto Brin; they were revolutionary warships at the time they were designed, being the first ironclad battleships to be built without a sailing rig, and they marked the beginning of a trend toward larger and larger guns. Brin originally intended a main battery of four 35-long-ton (36 t) guns in a pair of turrets placed centrally, but during the course of work on the ships, he increased the size to 65 long tons (66 t) and ultimately to 100 long tons (100 t).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Duilio was 109.16 meters (358 ft 2 in) long overall and had a beam of 19.74 m (64 ft 9 in) and an average draft of 8.31 m (27 ft 3 in).
