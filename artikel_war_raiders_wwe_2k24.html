                <p>Sydney Jeannine Zmrzel (born May 19, 1997) is an American professional wrestler, model, and dancer. She is signed to WWE, where she performs on the Raw brand with the ring name Maxxine Dupri and is a member of the Alpha Academy stable.</p>
<h3 id="section-early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>Zmrzel was born in Loomis, California. Before her tenure with WWE, she was a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Rams, and has also been a dancer for the Phoenix Suns.</p>

<h5 id="section-valet-role-20212023">Valet role (2021–2023)</h5>
<p>In August 2021, Zmrzel participated in a WWE tryout in Las Vegas, Nevada, and became one of the 14 attendees to earn a contract with the company. Her first televised appearance was when she served as the poker dealer in the Poker Showdown segment between Duke Hudson and Cameron Grimes on NXT. Zmrzel first transitioned into professional wrestling in 2022 on NXT as a valet with Robert Stone for Von Wagner under the ring name Sofia Cromwell.</p>
<p>On the July 22, 2022, episode of SmackDown, Dupri made her debut on the main roster as Maxxine Dupri, Max Dupri's (kayfabe) sister and the Director of Talent for his heel Maximum Male Models stable consisting of ma.çé and mån.sôör. On the October 7 episode of SmackDown, Max would go on to leave the stable and re-establish himself as LA Knight, leaving her as the stable's manager. In February 2023, Maximum Male Models were moved to the Raw brand.</p>
<h5 id="section-alpha-academy-2023present">Alpha Academy (2023–present)</h5>
<p>Following the move to Raw, Dupri would begin a comedic storyline with Otis where she would attempt to recruit and encourage him to become a member of Maximum Male Models. This would later start a series of segments between Dupri and Chad Gable (Otis' tag team partner), where they both wanted Otis to be on their respective side. She eventually left Maximum Male Models and joined Alpha Academy, turning babyface for the first time in her career.</p>
<p>On the June 12 episode of Raw, Dupri performed an arm drag on Valhalla of The Viking Raiders and began her first feud. Otis and Gable trained Dupri in backstage segments to prepare for her in-ring debut. She debuted in a mixed tag team match between Alpha Academy and The Viking Raiders on the July 3 episode of Raw, where Alpha Academy won with Dupri pinning Valhalla. On the July 10 episode of Raw, Alpha Academy held a graduation ceremony for Dupri with Gable presenting Dupri her own Alpha Academy letterman's jacket at the end of the ceremony. As Dupri was about to put on the jacket, The Viking Raiders appeared on the ramp to distract Alpha Academy. Valhalla then attacked Dupri from behind and stole her jacket. In the following episode of Raw, Gable and Otis fought Erik and Ivar in a "Viking Rules" match. Despite dominating the match, Gable and Otis lost but Dupri managed to take her jacket back.  On the July 31 episode of Raw, Dupri defeated Valhalla with a Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex in her debut singles match. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Dupri participated in the battle royal for a Women's World Championship match at Survivor Series but was eliminated by Nia Jax. Two weeks later, Dupri teamed up with Diamond Mine's Ivy Nile in a fatal-four way tag team match for a WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match in a losing effort. On December 5, Dupri had her first match in NXT where Gable, Otis and herself defeated The Meta-Four (Noam Dar, Oro Mensah and Lash Legend) in a six-person mixed tag team match. On the December 11 episode of Raw, Dupri faced the Women's World Champion Rhea Ripley in a non-title match where she was conclusively defeated by submission in just over two minutes. Dupri made her Royal Rumble match debut at the titular event on January 27, 2024, entering as the 18th entrant. She lasted over six minutes and was eliminated by eventual winner Bayley. On the April 22 episode of Raw, Dupri competed in her first title match in a battle royal for the vacated Women's World Championship. She managed to eliminate Candice LeRae and Indi Hartwell but was eliminated by Nia Jax and ultimately won by Becky Lynch. Around the same time, Gable turned heel after failing to win the Intercontinental Championship multiple times, with Gable assigning blame that he had spent too much time training his "loser" stablemates and declaring that the stable's focus is to win Gable the Intercontinental Championship. After weeks of mistreatment by Gable on the rest of the stable for not assisting him to win the title by cheating, Dupri, Otis and Akira Tozawa walked out on Gable on the June 17 episode of Raw. Gable subsequently formed the American Made stable with The Creed Brothers and Nile, who turned on Dupri.</p>
<p>In March 2025, Dupri approached Natalya in order to improve her ring work but was consistently rebuffed. The pair eventually teamed together on the April 11 episode of SmackDown, where they entered the tag team gauntlet match for a WWE Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 41 but were defeated by Bayley and Women's Intercontinental Champion Lyra Valkyria.</p>
