<h1>A Rat's Mass</h1>
            
            A Rat's Mass is a poetic, magical-realist one-act play written in 1967 by African-American playwright Adrienne Kennedy. The play portrays the negative aspects of the black experience in the United States by depicting two African-American children longing for a white child. The play was, like many of Kennedy's plays, not aligned with the Black Arts movement, with a focus on dislocation and femaleness rather than the ideology of blackness.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Characters ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot summary ==<br/><br/>Like many of Kennedy's plays, A Rat's Mass doesn't follow a standard chronological plot. It follows Kay and Blake (Sister Rat and Brother Rat), black siblings who commit a sexual act on the playground at the insistence of Rosemary, a white child who Blake loves. The play takes place in Brother and Sister Rat's house, which they refer to as a cathedral. Sister Rat explains that her mother sent her away to Georgia when she became pregnant with her brother's baby, and the play is Brother Rat and Sister Rat's commiseration on their circumstances. The two siblings discuss Rosemary's beauty and how their house was once a religious place that now runs red with blood; Rosemary explains to the siblings that they are no longer holy. The plot must be ascertained from the non-chronological and absurdist dialogue between the characters. A 1969 New York Times review stated: "The action is nothing but Brother and Sister Rat equating their love for each other with their former adoration for Rosemary - the white and beautiful 'descendant of the Pope and Julius Caesar and the Virgin Mary'."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Allegory and symbolism ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Historical reasoning ==<br/><br/>The play was written in 1967, during the civil rights movement.
