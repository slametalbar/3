            The 1942 Indianapolis 500 was scheduled for Saturday May 30, 1942, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It was to be the 30th annual running of the famous automobile race. The race was canceled due to the United States involvement in World War II. In total, the Indianapolis 500 was not held from 1942 to 1945.<br/><br/>This was the second instance in which the Indianapolis Motor Speedway suspended the annual running of the Indianapolis 500. During World War I the Speedway management voluntarily suspended competition in 1917–1918. However, for World War II, the decision to cancel the race was more resolute, and ultimately was part of a four-year nationwide ban on automobile racing.<br/><br/>During the war, the track was closed and neglected, and fell into a terrible state of disrepair. Towards the end of the war, revival of the "500" appeared unlikely, and the facility was in danger of being demolished in favor of development.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Offseason ===<br/><br/>Following the 1941 race, the 1941 National Championship was won by Rex Mays. With the hostilities of World War II escalating abroad, rumors began to circulate during the summer of 1941 that the 1942 race may be suspended.
