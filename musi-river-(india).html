            The Musi River, also known as Muchukunda or Musunuru river, is a major tributary of the Krishna River in the Deccan Plateau, flowing through Telangana, India. Hyderabad stands on the banks of the Musi River, and the river divides the historic Old City from the newer part of the city. Musi  flows into Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar, which are artificial lakes that act as reservoirs that once supplied the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad with drinking water. Musi originates in the Ananthagiri Hills, near Vikarabad. It generally flows towards the east, turning south at Chittaloor. It flows into the Krishna River at Vadapally near Miryalaguda in Nalgonda district.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>According to some accounts, the river derived its name from two tributaries — Moosa and Esi which originate in Ananthagiri forest and have supposed to have been merged with each other near Langar Houz. As per others, the river was also once named as Musunuru or Muchukunda. According to the Hindu mythology, Muchukunda was a king who later became a sage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Musi River Historic Buildings ==<br/><br/>Women's College, Koti<br/><br/>Telangana High Court<br/><br/>City college<br/><br/>Osmania General Hospital<br/><br/>State Central Library<br/><br/>City college, Osmania General Hospital, State Central Library, Telangana High Court and Women's College were included in the list of  2025 World Monuments Watch, by the New York-based organisation World Monuments Fund.
