            Wendigo is a 2001 American independent psychological horror film written and directed by Larry Fessenden, starring Patricia Clarkson and Jake Weber. The film concerns a photographer, George, and his family who experience the presence of a dark force in a cabin during their wintry weekend at upstate New York while being stalked by a local hunter after accidentally hitting a deer on the road. Meanwhile, George's son, Miles, begins to have vivid hallucinations of the legendary Wendigo, who he believes to be responsible for the dark forces.<br/><br/>The film was produced by Antidote Films and Glass Eye Pix, and was distributed by Magnolia Pictures. It was released to theatres on January 23, 2001, for a limited time, and received mixed reviews by critics. The film was not a major box office attraction and bombed as it scored $1,107 on opening weekend.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>George (Jake Weber) is a highly-strung professional photographer who is starting to unravel from the stress of his work with a Manhattan advertising agency. Needing some time away from the city, his wife Kim (Patricia Clarkson), and their 10-year-old son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) head to Upstate New York to take in the winter sights, though the drive up is hardly relaxing for any of them.<br/><br/>George accidentally hits and severely injures a deer that ran onto the icy road. When George stops to inspect the damage, he gets confronted by an angry local named Otis who flies into a rage, telling George that he and his fellow hunters had been tracking the deer for some time.
