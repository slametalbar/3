His promotion of the medical examination of political prisoners in Ireland sparked controversy.<br/><br/>He gave evidence to the Capital Sentences Committee (sitting 1886-1888) and in 1891 was involved in the training of the first three hangmen who were put on the list of persons competent to perform executions.<br/><br/>He was knighted in 1905, a Knight of the Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, and appointed a CBE in 1920.<br/><br/>In 1907 he gave the Bradshaw Lecture. In 1912 he was elected President of the British Medical Association.
