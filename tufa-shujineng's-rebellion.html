<h1>Tufa Shujineng's Rebellion</h1>
            
            Tufa Shujineng's Rebellion, also known as the Qin and Liang Provinces Rebellion (Chinese: 秦涼之變), was a tribal rebellion against the Western Jin dynasty from c.July 270 to early 280 during the Three Kingdoms period. It was led by the Xianbei chieftain Tufa Shujineng, who was joined by several tribal ethnic groups such as the Qiang and Di living in northwestern China. The rebellion lasted nearly a decade and reached its peak in 279 when rebel forces captured Liang province. However, the end of that same year would also see its end as Jin forces decisively defeated Shujineng and pacified the tribes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>During the Western Jin dynasty, northwestern China was home to various tribal ethnic groups. The neighbouring Qiang people to the west had been migrating inwards into the Longxi and Guanzhong regions as early as the Western Han dynasty, where they would often rebel due to oppressive policies by the local Han governors. The Di people, despite their relatively stable relation with the Han dynasty, also began rebelling with the Qiang during the fall of Han, and in 219, the statesman, Cao Cao, had 50,000 of them relocated from Wudu Commandery to live along the Wei River in the Guanzhong. Descendants of the Xiongnu such as the Lushuihu and Chuge also resided in the northwest. <br/><br/>At the time, the Xianbei tribes of the northern steppe were migrating southward into the Chinese interior. Many of them were able to easily cross into and roam the Hexi Corridor, where one tribe, the Tufa, began asserting considerable influence within the region.
