            Churchill is a neighborhood in Holyoke, Massachusetts located to the south of the city center, adjacent to the downtown. Its name is a geographic portmanteau as the area was historically known as the Church Hill district prior to its extensive development in the early twentieth century. Located at the southwestern edge of the downtown grid, the area served as housing for mill workers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and today contains 166 acres (67 ha) of mixed residential and commercial zoning, including a number of historical brick tenements as well as the headquarters of the Holyoke Housing Authority, Holyoke Senior Center, Churchill Homes public housing, and the Wistariahurst Museum. In 2024 a section of this historic housing was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Central Churchill Historic District.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Holyoke grew rapidly in its first decades, a number of tenements and worker housing was constructed on the grid's south side. Seeing this growth, one Father P.J. Harkins, pastor of St. Jerome's in Holyoke Center purchased a large tract of land at the corner of Maple and Sargeant Street. Within the year the neighborhood's most prominent church, the Church of the Sacred Heart, had its cornerstone placed during the American centennial of July 4, 1876, and over the course of the next two decades a rectory and school buildings were constructed on the adjacent land.<br/><br/>One of the most prominent secular community organizations of the early 20th century was the Churchill Athletic and Social Club, which maintained at least a baseball team, as early as 1904. Most commonly referred to as the Churchill Athletic Club (CAC), the group's football team, generally known as "the Churchills", would be local reigning champions among other teams in the Connecticut Valley leagues in 1916.
