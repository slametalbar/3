            Mary Perry Stone (May 9, 1909 – June 6, 2007) was an American painter, sculptor, and muralist. She is best known for her social protest artwork. Her archives are held in the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Mary Perry was born on May 9, 1909, in Jamestown, Rhode Island. At the age of 15, she went to New York City to study art at the Art Students League of New York. After high school, she completed her art training at Traphagen School of Fashion and Design in New York. At the same time, she studied sculpture at the New School for Social Research with sculptor Aaron J. Goodelman. Recalling this time in a taped interview for the Smithsonian Archives, she said she initially worked in clay, which would be cast into plaster, and that by the time she was 21, she had learned to carve marble and other stone. It was Goodelman who submitted Perry's sculpture of a dancer to an April 1934 Metropolitan Museum of Art layman exhibit. Her sculpture won an honorable mention.
