                <p>Leati Joseph Anoaʻi (Samoan pronunciation: [a.noˈaʔ.i] ah-no-AH ee; born May 25, 1985), better known by his ring name Roman Reigns, is an American professional wrestler and former football player. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand. Regarded as one of the best professional wrestlers in the world, Reigns' 1,316-day reign with the WWE Universal Championship is the fourth longest world title reign in WWE history and the longest championship reign since 1988.</p>
<p>After playing U.S. college football for Georgia Tech, Anoaʻi started a professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. A member of the Anoaʻi wrestling family, Anoaʻi was signed by WWE in 2010 and made his main roster debut under the ring name Roman Reigns in 2012 as a member of The Shield alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins: with Rollins, Reigns has held the WWE Tag Team Championship once. The trio teamed together until disbanding in 2014, after which Reigns entered singles competition.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2020, WWE positioned Reigns as a heroic character and attempted to establish him as their next "face of the company", which was met with intense disapproval by audiences and critics. During this period, Reigns won the WWE Championship three times, the WWE Universal Championship once, the WWE United States Championship and WWE Intercontinental Championship once each, was named Superstar of the Year at the 2014 Slammy Awards and won the Royal Rumble match in 2015. After a hiatus, Reigns was repackaged as a villainous character between 2020 and 2024, which was generally met with acclaim by audiences and critics. Reigns then held the WWE Championship and Universal Championship simultaneously, being recognized as Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.</p>
<p>Reigns has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, a record ten times. Reigns holds the joint-record for most eliminations in a Survivor Series match (4) and held the previous record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match (12). He is also WWE's 28th Triple Crown Champion and 17th Grand Slam Champion and was ranked at No. 1 in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's annual PWI 500 list of the top 500 singles wrestlers in 2016 and 2022.</p>
<h3 id="section-early-life">Early life</h3>

Both his father and his brother Rosey were professional wrestlers. As a member of the Anoaʻi wrestling family, his cousins include The Tonga Kid, Rikishi, Umaga, and Yokozuna, while his first cousins once removed include The Usos and Solo Sikoa. Anoaʻi attended Pensacola Catholic High School before transferring to Escambia High School. He majored in management at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
<h3 id="section-football-career">Football career</h3>
<p>Anoaʻi played football for three years at Pensacola Catholic High School and one year at Escambia High School; in his senior year, he was named Defensive Player of the Year by the Pensacola News Journal.

Anoaʻi was a three-year starter beginning in his sophomore year and was also one of the team captains as a senior. He earned first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors in 2006 after recording 40 tackles, two recovered fumbles and 4.5 sacks.</p>
<p>After going undrafted in the 2007 NFL draft, Anoaʻi was signed by the Minnesota Vikings in May 2007. He was diagnosed with leukemia after his team physical and was released later that month. The Jacksonville Jaguars signed him in August 2007, only to release Anoaʻi less than a week later before the start of the 2007 NFL season. In 2008, he was signed by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Wearing the number 99, Anoaʻi played for one season with the Eskimos, featuring in five games, of which he started three.

The trio declared themselves The Shield, vowed to rally against "injustice" and denied working for Punk, but routinely emerged from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries. This led to a six-man tag team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 16, where The Shield defeated Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) and Ryback in their debut match. They continued to aid Punk after TLC, both on Raw and at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2013 It was revealed on the January 28 episode of Raw that Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for them.The Shield then quietly ended their association with Punk while beginning a feud with Cena, Ryback and Sheamus, who they defeated on February 17 at Elimination Chamber.

The following night on Raw, Rollins turned on The Shield and aligned himself with Triple H and The Authority.</p>

After ruling out Samoa Joe and Buddy Murphy as suspects, Reigns next investigated Daniel Bryan and Erick Rowan due to testimony from Murphy and seemingly incriminating video footage. However, Bryan revealed the attacker as a man who merely resembled Rowan. Nonetheless, Reigns found additional footage that showed Rowan pushing over the equipment. Rowan then admitted that it was him and said he was responsible for the hit and run as well, causing him and Bryan to split due to him lying.

However, in late March, Reigns pulled out of the event amid concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and being immunocompromised from his leukemia, and he was replaced by Braun Strowman. Following WrestleMania, Reigns continued to remain absent from WWE programming in the midst of the pandemic, telling Hindustan Times: "For me, I just had to make a choice for my family. The company (WWE) has done everything that they can to make it the safest work environment possible. It is not the workplace that I was necessarily concerned about. The decision was taken mainly because each performer travels so much, and we are all such a diverse group and from all over the place. I'm not convinced, and I can't trust the fact that everybody is taking it as seriously and locking themselves down at home like I am. I trust my life with my co-workers every time I step foot in the ring, but I just can't put the same trust when it has my children, my wife, and my family involved."</p>
<h5 id="section-the-tribal-chief-20202024">The Tribal Chief (2020–2024)</h5>
<p>After a five-month hiatus, Reigns returned at SummerSlam on August 23, attacking new Universal Champion "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt and Strowman after their title match. On the following SmackDown, Reigns aligned himself with his new manager, Paul Heyman, turning heel for the first time since 2014. At Payback on August 30, Reigns defeated defending champion The Fiend and Strowman in a No Holds Barred triple threat match to win the Universal Championship for the second time.</p>
<p>At Clash of Champions on September 27, Reigns made his first successful title defense against his cousin Jey Uso by technical knockout, after Reigns viciously beat down Jey and Jimmy Uso threw in the towel. On the October 16 episode of SmackDown, Reigns retained the title against Strowman. At Hell in a Cell on October 25, Reigns again retained the title against Jey in an "I Quit" Hell in a Cell match by making him quit after attacking the injured Jimmy. Due to the loss, Jey was ordered to follow Reigns' commands and address him as "The Tribal Chief", turning him heel. At Survivor Series on November 22, Reigns defeated WWE Champion Drew McIntyre in an interbrand champion vs. champion match.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Reigns reignited his feud with Kevin Owens after believing Owens disrespected his family, culminating in successful defenses against Owens in a TLC match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 20, in a steel cage match on the December 25 episode of SmackDown, and in a Last Man Standing match at Royal Rumble on January 31, 2021. Reigns began feuding with Royal Rumble match winner Edge and retained his title against Daniel Bryan at Elimination Chamber on February 21 and Fastlane on March 21. In the main event of Night 2 of WrestleMania 37 on April 11, Reigns defeated Bryan and Edge in a triple threat match to retain the title with assistance from Jey.

<p>The following week, Reigns was attacked by the returning Edge, leading to a match between the two at Money in the Bank on July 18, where Reigns retained the title after interference from Seth Rollins. After the match, Reigns was confronted by a returning John Cena. Over the following weeks, Cena challenged Reigns for a title match at SummerSlam, which he initially rejected before Cena hijacked a contract signing between Reigns and Finn Bálor to make the match official. At the event on August 21, Reigns defeated Cena to retain the title; he was confronted by a returning Brock Lesnar after the match. Reigns successfully defended the title against Bálor on the September 3 episode of SmackDown and in an Extreme Rules match at Extreme Rules on September 26 with Bálor in his Demon persona.

At Survivor Series on November 21, Reigns defeated WWE Champion Big E in a champion vs. champion match.

<p>A match for the Universal Championship between Reigns and Lesnar was then set for Day 1. On the December 17 episode of SmackDown, Reigns fired Heyman as his manager due to Heyman's past association with Lesnar. On January 1, 2022, the day of the event, the match between Reigns and Lesnar was cancelled as a result of Reigns testing positive for COVID-19. On January 16, Reigns surpassed Lesnar's 503-day reign to become the longest reigning Universal Champion, in turn having the sixth longest world championship reign in the company's history. At Royal Rumble on January 29, Reigns defended the championship against Seth "Freakin" Rollins, losing the match by disqualification; since championships cannot change hands by disqualification, Reigns retained the title. Later that night, he interfered in the WWE Championship match between Lesnar and Bobby Lashley, reuniting with Heyman to cause the upset victory for Lashley to regain the championship. Also that night, Lesnar won the Royal Rumble match, and on the following episode of Raw, he challenged Reigns to a match in the main event of WrestleMania 38, marking the third time Reigns would face Lesnar in the main event of WrestleMania. At Elimination Chamber on February 19, Reigns defeated Goldberg via technical submission to retain the title. Later in the event, Lesnar won the WWE Championship in an Elimination Chamber match, turning their match at WrestleMania into a Winner Takes All match.</p>
<p>On Night 2 of WrestleMania 38 on April 3, Reigns defeated Lesnar to win the WWE Championship for a fourth time and became the first wrestler to hold both the WWE Championship and WWE Universal Championship simultaneously and be recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. At WrestleMania Backlash on May 8, Reigns and The Usos defeated RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) and Drew McIntyre. On the June 17 episode of SmackDown, Reigns successfully defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Riddle, but after the match, he was attacked by a returning Lesnar to renew their rivalry and set up a Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam on July 30, which Reigns won to end their seven-year feud. At Clash at the Castle on September 3, Reigns successfully defended the titles against McIntyre after interference from the debuting Solo Sikoa.

Three weeks later at Survivor Series: WarGames on November 26, Reigns, along with The Bloodline, defeated McIntyre, Kevin Owens and The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus, Ridge Holland and Butch) in a WarGames match.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2023, his Universal Championship reign reached 871 days, breaking Gunther's NXT UK Championship reign of 870 days, giving him the longest reign of any WWE championship since 1988. At Royal Rumble on January 28, Reigns successfully defended the titles against Owens for the fourth time. Following the match, Sami Zayn would turn on The Bloodline, smashing Reigns with a chair. He then began feuding with Cody Rhodes, who won the Royal Rumble match and earned a match against Reigns in the Night 2 main event of WrestleMania 39. At Elimination Chamber on February 18, Reigns retained the titles against Zayn. At Night 2 of WrestleMania 39 on April 2, Reigns successfully defended the titles against Rhodes after interference from Sikoa.</p>
<p>At Night of Champions on May 27, Reigns and Sikoa unsuccessfully challenged Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. During the match, The Usos interfered and accidentally attacked Sikoa while aiming for Zayn. The subsequent sequence of events culminated in Jimmy Uso attacking Reigns, and The Usos walking away from The Bloodline. It was on this day as well, that Reigns hit 1,000 days as Universal Champion, the first to do so in over thirty-five years, and only the fifth wrestler ever to accomplish the feat with a world championship in the history of WWE. On June 24, Reigns reached 1,028 days as Universal Champion, passing Pedro Morales' reign of 1,027 days with the WWE Championship (at the time known as the WWWF Heavyweight Championship), giving Reigns the fifth longest world championship reign in company history. At Money in the Bank on July 1, Reigns and Sikoa lost to The Usos in a "Bloodline Civil War" tag team match after Reigns was pinned by Jey, marking his first pinfall loss since December 2019. On August 5, at SummerSlam, Reigns defeated Jey in Tribal Combat to retain the titles and his status as Tribal Chief, after Jimmy betrayed Jey. At Crown Jewel on November 4, Reigns successfully defended the titles against LA Knight. At Royal Rumble on January 27, 2024, Reigns defeated Knight, Randy Orton and AJ Styles, who Reigns pinned, to retain the titles in a fatal four-way match.</p>
<p>On the February 2 episode of SmackDown, Rhodes, who again won the Royal Rumble match, said that he would not challenge Reigns for the titles at WrestleMania XL, after which The Rock confronted Reigns, implying he would be Reigns' opponent instead. After this development drew backlash for disrupting their long-term storyline, during the WrestleMania XL Kickoff media event on February 8, Rhodes announced that he would face Reigns. On Night 1 of WrestleMania XL on April 7, Reigns and The Rock defeated Rhodes and Seth Rollins to enforce Bloodline Rules for their title match. The next night, Reigns lost the titles to Rhodes, ending his second record-setting Universal Championship reign at 1,316 days and ending his fourth WWE Championship reign at 735 days.</p>
<h5 id="section-the-otc-2024present">The O.T.C. (2024–present)</h5>
<p>After losing the titles, Reigns took time off from television and Sikoa was appointed himself as the de facto leader of The Bloodline. The formation changed when Jimmy was kicked out of the group and The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa), the sons of Haku, as well as Jacob Fatu, the son of the Tonga Kid, were included into the stable. On the April 26 episode of SmackDown, Paul Heyman announced that Reigns voluntarily withdrew from the 2024 WWE Draft. After weeks of bypassing Reigns' orders in storyline and ousting Heyman from the group, Sikoa removed Reigns from the leadership of The Bloodline and the group altogether, declaring himself as the new "Tribal Chief".</p>
<p>Following a four-month hiatus, on August 3, Reigns made his return at SummerSlam under the new moniker "The O.T.C" ("The Only Tribal Chief" or "The Original Tribal Chief"), attacking Sikoa and helping Rhodes retain his title in a Bloodline Rules match, turning face for the first time since 2020. At Bad Blood on October 5, Reigns and Rhodes defeated Sikoa and Fatu after interference from the returning Jimmy Uso. On the October 25 episode of SmackDown, Reigns and the reunited Usos cost The Tongans the WWE Tag Team Championships, setting up a six-man tag team match against Sikoa, Tonga and Fatu at Crown Jewel on November 2, which they lost. At Survivor Series: WarGames on November 30, Reigns, the Usos, Sami Zayn and CM Punk defeated The Bloodline and Bronson Reed in a WarGames match, with Reigns pinning Sikoa. Reigns then challenged Sikoa for the Ula Fala and Tribal Chief title in Tribal Combat at the Raw premiere on Netflix on January 6, 2025, where Reigns defeated Sikoa to reclaim his Ula Fala and Tribal Chief title, with The Rock presenting Reigns with the Ula Fala after the match ending their feud.</p>
<p>At Royal Rumble on February 1, Reigns entered the Royal Rumble match at number 16, scoring four eliminations. As he and Rollins attempted to eliminate each other, both were eliminated from behind by Punk. Rollins then delivered multiple Curb Stomps to Reigns before storming off. He returned on the March 10 episode of Raw to attack both Rollins and Punk during their steel cage match. On the March 21 episode of SmackDown, a brawl ensued between all three men, with Reigns, Rollins, and Punk pointing at the WrestleMania sign, leading to a triple threat match between the three being made official as the Night 1 main event of WrestleMania 41. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown, Punk revealed that Paul Heyman would not be in Reigns' corner at WrestleMania 41, but instead in his own, as part of a favor Punk called in for teaming with Reigns at Survivor Series. At WrestleMania 41, Rollins won the match after Paul Heyman betrayed both Punk and Reigns.</p>
