            Manuel Gregorio Acosta (1921–1989) was a Mexican-born American painter, muralist, sculptor, and illustrator. His work received more recognition during the Chicano movement, and his portrait of Cesar Chavez was reproduced on the cover of Time magazine in 1969.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Manuel Gregorio Acosta was born on May 9, 1921 into a family in Aldama, Chihuahua, Mexico. His father, Ramón P. Acosta, had fought in the Mexican Revolution with Pancho Villa, and the Mexican Revolution was a recurring theme in Manuel's paintings. The family moved to El Paso, Texas when Manuel was a child. Acosta attended Bowie High School, where he started studying art. He always seemed interested in drawings, so as practice he would mock pictures of newspapers and later started drawing pin up girls. Manuel Acosta served in the United States Air Force during World War II, during which time he continued practicing his artwork, and became an American citizen shortly after discharge.<br/><br/>In the fall of 1946 he attended the College of Mines and Metallurgy (now the University of Texas at El Paso), where he studied drawing and sculpture under sculptor Urbici Soler. He started to sketch people and views from El Paso's barrios in a realistic style.
