            Robert Greenhalgh Albion (August 15, 1896 in Malden, Massachusetts – August 9, 1983 in Groton, Connecticut) was Harvard's first professor of Oceanic History and inspired two generations of maritime historians in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Albion was born in 1896 in Malden, Massachusetts, to James Francis Albion, a Universalist minister, and Alice Marion Lamb. In 1904, the family moved to South Portland, Maine. Albion maintained a home there until his wife died in 1975.<br/><br/>Albion became interested in journalism and shipping while studying economics at Bowdoin College, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1918. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa society. After serving as a second lieutenant in the Army Infantry at the end of World War One, he became a graduate at Harvard University. He received his master's degree in 1920 and completed his doctorate in British history in 1924 with a dissertation on Forests and Sea Power: The Timber Problem of the Royal Navy. Published in 1926, this work was a highly influential study that combined his interests in ships, British history, and economics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Professional career ==<br/><br/>He began his teaching career at Princeton University as an instructor of British history in 1922 and he taught a popular course in maritime history, rising to be professor of history and assistant dean of the faculty.
