            The 7th Guards Army was a field army of the Red Army during World War II and of the Soviet Army during the Cold War. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The 7th Guards Army was formed from the 64th Army on April 16, 1943. <br/><br/>64th Army had originally been formed from 1st Reserve Army in July 1942, and alongside the 62nd Army, fought the German offensive during the Battle of Stalingrad to a standstill, for which it was raised to Guards status. General Lieutenant M.S. Shumilov, who had commanded the 64th Army, continued to command 7th Guards Army through the rest of the war, though he was promoted to General Colonel in October 1943.<br/><br/>It included the 15th, 36th, 72nd, 73rd, 78th and 81st Guards Rifle Divisions, which were incorporated in the 24th and 25th Guards Rifle Corps. As part of the Voronezh Front and the Steppe Front since July 18, 1943, the Army participated in the Battle of Kursk and the Battle for the Dnieper River from July through August, 1943. Subsequently, as part of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, it participated in the Kirovograd Offensive, and those of Uman–Botoșani, Jassy–Kishinev, Debrecen, Budapest, Bratislava and Brno, and Prague. <br/><br/>The 7th Guards Army was stationed in Austria as part of the Central Group of Forces briefly after the war. On 1 May 1945 it comprised 23rd Rifle Corps (19th and 252nd Rifle Divisions), 25th Guards Rifle Corps (4th and 6th Guards Airborne Divisions, 25th Guards Rifle Division, 303rd Rifle Division, and 27th Guards Rifle Corps (72nd Guards, 141st, 375th, and 409th Rifle Divisions.
