<p>Beginning with this season, the team who finished with the best overall regular season record would receive the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, named in honor of Maurice Podoloff, who served as the commissioner of the NBA from 1946 to 1963.

The MVP trophy was then renamed in honor of Michael Jordan, a five-time winner and often considered the greatest player in league history. A new award, the Clutch Player of the Year Award, was also introduced to honor players who best come through for their teammates in the clutch. This trophy was named after Jerry West.</p>
<p>The league also announced updated trophy designs for the Coach of the Year Award, Defensive Player of the Year Award, Executive of the Year Award, Most Improved Player Award, Rookie of the Year Award, Sixth Man of the Year Award, Sportsmanship Award, and the Teammate of the Year Award.

<p>This was the seventh year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV. ESPN broadcasts Wednesday and Friday night games for most of the season, and games during selected Sunday nights from February to April. ABC aired NBA Saturday Primetime on eight Saturday nights between December and March, with a tripleheader on January 28, the first tripleheader on the network outside of Christmas Day, along with a Saturday afternoon game on January 14. The network also broadcast NBA Sunday Showcase on three selected Sunday afternoons in February and early March. TNT airs Tuesday games all season, and Thursday games from January to April. NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when neither ESPN/ABC nor TNT are airing games nationally.</p>
<p>Five Christmas Day games were scheduled for this season. ABC was originally scheduled to air just a tripleheader, but it was later decided that all five Christmas games would be simulcast across both ABC and ESPN for the first time, likely in an attempt to counterprogram the NFL's scheduling of a Christmas Day tripleheader for the first time. Previously, the most Christmas games that either network had ever aired in any given season was three.</p>
<p>Four Martin Luther King Jr. Day games were nationally televised, with TNT and NBA TV each airing two games.</p>
<p>The NBA designed January 24–28 as "NBA Rivals Week", with every nationally televised game featuring "classic and budding rivalries between teams and players".</p>
<p>On March 8, ESPN had another all-female crew for an NBA game for the second straight year. The 7:30pm (ET) telecast between the Dallas Mavericks and the New Orleans Pelicans had Beth Mowins and Doris Burke as commentators, with Cassidy Hubbarth on the sideline, while the 10:00pm (ET) telecast between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers had Mike Breen and Mark Jackson as commentators, with reporter Ros Gold-Onwude joining the broadcast team as an analyst/color commentator.</p>
<p>On the final day of the regular season, April 9, two games with playoff implications were flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.</p>
<h4 id="section-local">Local</h4>
<p>In September 2022, Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in NBC Sports Washington, which carries broadcasts of the Washington Wizards and the NHL's Washington Capitals, both Monumental-owned teams. Monumental initially took minority ownership of the network in 2016. NBC provided transitional corporate, technical, and distribution support up to 18 months after the sale, and Monumental plans to rebrand the network after the 2022–23 season.</p>
<p>In October 2022, the Clippers launched a direct-to-consumer streaming service called ClipperVision. The service includes all non-national games. The Clippers also announced an agreement with Nexstar Media Group to air four preseason games and 11 regular season games on KTLA, KSWB-TV, KGET-TV and KSEE-TV. The remaining games continued to air locally on Bally Sports West and Bally Sports SoCal.</p>
<p>On February 24, 2023, the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks sent letters to the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz saying they had until March 31, 2023, to reach an agreement to take their local television rights back. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owners of the networks, intends to leave the regional sports networks business. If a deal is not reached the networks would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Portland Trail Blazers's deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.</p>
<p>On March 14, Diamond Sports Group, the operator of the Bally Sports regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond plans to continue to broadcast games for the 16 NBA teams it has regional rights to while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.</p>

The defensive player who commits the foul will be assessed one common personal foul. Previously, the penalty was a common personal foul on the offending player in addition to a side out for the offensive team if they were not in the bonus.</p>
<p>Following the death of 11-time champion Bill Russell, the NBA permanently retired the number 6 across the league, the first time a player's number has been retired across the league. However, players who had the number 6 beforehand can keep their number unless they voluntarily change it or retire.</p>
<p>The NBA honored Russell with a jersey patch. Every team wore a commemorative patch on the right sleeve of their jerseys. Every NBA court honored Russell with a clover-shaped logo featuring the No. 6 on the sideline.</p>
