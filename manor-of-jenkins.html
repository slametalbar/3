            Jenkins was a manor under the overlordship of Barking manor. It was also known as 'Dagenham' manor, 'Dagenhams' and 'Dagenham Place' throughout the centuries. Today, the once open area has been consumed by suburbia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The Manor of Jenkins in Essex, England ==<br/><br/>It was originally property of the Abbey of Barking, and was granted status of a freehold. This meant throughout time it was put for lease and indeed some manorial Lords did also lease nearby tenements. As such the estate at its largest spread as far as Dagenham village and it was found in some historical records to have stretched as far as East Hall. The original estate was located in present-day Mayesbrook Park in the London Borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham, north of where Eastbury manor house stands today. Eastbury is a popular tourist attraction.<br/><br/>Records from 1540 suggest that, at an ancient and unknown time, Barking Abbey had allowed the holding of Jenkins to a family recorded as Fitz-stephen, at a rent of 4 shillings and 4 pence. In 1273 the manor of Jenkins was recorded as being held by Emery de Bezill, for a rent of 8 shillings 8 pence and a suit-court.
